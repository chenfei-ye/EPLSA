# Energy-based Phase-Locking State Analysis (EPLSA) for Brain State Identification

## Overview
This repository contains the implementation code for the research presented in the paper "Energy-based Phase-Locking State Analysis in Brain State Identification". The study addresses limitations in conventional brain energy landscape analysis (ELA) by introducing a novel computational framework—Energy-based Phase-Locking State Analysis (EPLSA)—that synergistically integrates instantaneous phase-coupling dynamics with rigorous energy landscape principles. This approach enables enhanced quantification of brain state stability and transitions, offering insights into neurodynamic mechanisms across cognitive tasks, consciousness states, and neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer’s diseas.

EPLSA demonstrates marked superiority over existing methods like Leading Eigenvector Dynamic Analysis (LEiDA) and amplitude-based ELA in terms of test-retest reliability, task-specific brain state differentiation, and individual-level classification performance. Validation across three independent neuroimaging datasets highlights its sensitivity to consciousness transitions (e.g., sleep-wake cycles) and pathological changes in Alzheimer’s disease, revealing altered state occupancy and transition probabilities correlated with cognitive impairment.

## Key Features
- Phase-Locking Integration: Unifies phase synchronization dynamics with thermodynamic formalism for robust stability quantification.
- ​Multistate Brain Analysis: Identifies and characterizes brain states using energy-based principles, improving sensitivity to transitions and individual differences.
- Cross-Condition Validation: Evaluated on cognitive tasks, sleep-wake states, and neurodegenerative data, showing consistent performance gains.
- ​Clinical Relevance: Detects state-specific anomalies in Alzheimer’s disease (e.g., dwell time changes in FPCN-DMN and VIS-LMN co-activation states) correlated with cognitive metrics.

## Code Availability
We are actively preparing the code files to ensure full reproducibility and ease of use. The complete codebase—including preprocessing scripts, EPLSA implementation, and example datasets—is scheduled to be uploaded by ​Sunday, November 9, 2025. This will allow users to replicate the experiments and apply EPLSA to their own data.
